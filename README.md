# WordPress Cloudflare Images Integration (WIP)

This plugin lets you upload and offload image to [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/) which serve, optimize, resize at scale, low cost.

The plugin is work in progress and it's actively development. Use at your own risk. More detailed documentation will available on April.

## Roadmap
- [x]  Offload single image manually
- [ ]  Offload automatically when upload
- [ ]  WordPress.org repo
- [ ]  Batch upload images. Currently, CF doesn't have that feature, we have to upload one-by-one.
